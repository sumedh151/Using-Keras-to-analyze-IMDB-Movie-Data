# Using-Keras-to-analyze-IMDB-Movie-Data
Project to analyze a dataset from IMDB and use it to predict the sentiment analysis of a review.
# About the dataset
The dataset is of 25,000 IMDB reviews. Each review comes with a label. A label of 0 is given to a negative review, and a label of 1 is given to a positive review. In this project we have created a model that will predict the sentiment of a review, based on the words in the review. You can see more information about this dataset in the Keras website.
